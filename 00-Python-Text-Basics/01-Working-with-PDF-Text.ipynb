There are [many libraries in Python for working with PDFs](https://reachtim.com/articles/PDF-Manipulation.html), each with their pros and cons, the most common one being **PyPDF2**. You can install it with (note the case-sensitivity, you need to make sure your capitilization matches):\n\n    pip install PyPDF2\n    \nKeep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted, or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to be read. If you find yourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.\n\nAs far as PyPDF2 is concerned, it can only read the text from a PDF document, it won't be able to grab images or other media files from a PDF.\n___\n\n## Working with PyPDF2\n\nLet's begin by showing the basics of the PyPDF2 library."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"1d50e2c7-6df0-4d69-af23-fc8d69b2199a","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pip install PyPDF2"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"16f8390c-cb61-4aa0-9221-fdf707e04d62","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"name":null,"datasetInfos":[],"data":"Python interpreter will be restarted.\nCollecting PyPDF2\n  Downloading pypdf2-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (232 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing_extensions>=3.10.0.0 in /databricks/python3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from PyPDF2) (3.10.0.2)\nInstalling collected packages: PyPDF2\nSuccessfully installed PyPDF2-3.0.1\nPython interpreter will be restarted.\n","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"ansi","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Python interpreter will be restarted.\nCollecting PyPDF2\n  Downloading pypdf2-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (232 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing_extensions>=3.10.0.0 in /databricks/python3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from PyPDF2) (3.10.0.2)\nInstalling collected packages: PyPDF2\nSuccessfully installed PyPDF2-3.0.1\nPython interpreter will be restarted.\n"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# note the capitalization\nimport PyPDF2"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"c9a28a17-0f8b-47e1-aca6-890698918a89","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Reading PDFs\n\nFirst we open a pdf, then create a reader object for it.
